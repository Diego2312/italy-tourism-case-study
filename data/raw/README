-- GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)
Source: World Bank
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?name_desc=false
Description:
This indicator provides values for gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in current international dollars, 
converted by purchasing power parities (PPPs). PPPs account for the different price levels across countries and thus PPP-based comparisons of economic output are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants than exchange-rate based comparisons. 
Gross domestic product is the total income earned through the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production approach. 
This series has been linked to produce a consistent time series to counteract breaks in series over time due to changes in base years, source data and methodologies. Thus, it may not be comparable with other national accounts series in the database for historical years. 
The core indicator has been divided by the general population to achieve a per capita estimate. This indicator is expressed in current prices, meaning no adjustment has been made to account for price changes over time. The PPP conversion factor is a currency conversion factor and a spatial price deflator. 
PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries, thereby allowing volume or output comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components.

Description:
Unemployment refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.


-- Brent crude oil, (USD per barrel)
Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/commodity-markets
Description:
Italy is a Brent-priced market, meaning that transport and fuel costs in Europe are indexed to Brent crude prices.
Therefore, Brent crude serves as the appropriate proxy for oil-related travel costs, rather than WTI or other benchmarks.‚Äù
Brent crude is used as a proxy for fuel costs; higher Brent prices translate into higher jet fuel prices, which raise airline operating costs and ticket fares, disproportionately affecting long-haul tourists to Italy.
We use Brent crude oil annual prices in constant 2010 USD (World Bank Pink Sheet), which removes general inflation effects.
? For correlation analysis, we could use both log-levels and annual growth rates to capture both long-term trends and short-term cost shocks. ?


-- Exchange rate EUR vs national currency
Source: https://data.ecb.europa.eu/data/data-categories/ecbeurosystem-policy-and-exchange-rates/exchange-rates/reference-rates?searchTerm=&resetAllFilters=true
Description:
We use annual average bilateral exchange rates (local currency per EUR) from the ECB. 
Annual averages better reflect the exchange conditions faced by tourists over the year than end-of-period rates, which are more suitable for financial reporting.
? For robustness, we could analyze both levels (log values) and year-to-year changes. ?
