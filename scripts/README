Variables: GDP per capita, Exchange rate, Brent Crude Oil prices, Unemployment rate, Median age, Population.
Target: Tourist arrivals

Transformations:

Tourist arrivals
Transformation: Keep raw. log for robustness.
Reason: Distribution not heavily skewed. Main dependent variable.

GDP per capita (PPP)
Transformation: Log transformation, also delta log for growth interpretation.
Reason: Right-skewed, large across country differences. log stabilizes variance and allows % growth interpretation.

Exchange rates (vs. EUR)
Transformation: delta log or % change to allow growth interpretation
Reason: Highly skewed with extreme outliers (TRY, RUB); log compresses range and delta log (or percentage change) captures exchange rate shocks.

Oil price (Brent)
Transformation: No transformation or delta log (or % change) transformation for robustness
Reason: No hard skew, but growth interpretation can be benificial

Unemployment rate (%)
Transformation: Keep (%) or delta log for growth interpretation
Reason: Already in (%), can be more robust

Median age (years)
Transformation: Keep.
Reason: Smooth

Population growth
Transformation: Keep (%)
Reason: Already in change (%)
